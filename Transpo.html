    <h1>Future of Transportation</h1>
    <p>Advancements in technology have revolutionized the transportation sector, paving the way for 
        more efficient, sustainable, and connected modes of transportation. From electric vehicles and 
        autonomous systems to hyperloop and aerial mobility, new technologies are transforming the way 
        we travel. In this article, we explore the cutting-edge innovations that are reshaping the future 
        of transportation.</p>
    <h2>Electric Vehicles (EVs)</h2>
    <p>The rise of electric vehicles marks a significant shift towards sustainable transportation. 
        EVs offer lower emissions, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, and improved energy efficiency. 
        With advancements in battery technology, EVs now offer longer ranges and faster charging times. 
        The development of charging infrastructure further supports the adoption of EVs, making electric 
        transportation a viable and eco-friendly alternative.</p>
    <h2>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)</h2>
    <p>Autonomous vehicles are poised to revolutionize transportation by eliminating the need for 
        human drivers. With advancements in sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, 
        AVs can navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make informed decisions in real-time. 
        Self-driving cars have the potential to enhance road safety, reduce traffic congestion, 
        and provide mobility options for the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
    <h2>Hyperloop Technology</h2>
    <p>Hyperloop technology aims to revolutionize long-distance transportation by propelling pods at 
        high speeds through low-pressure tubes. Using magnetic levitation and vacuum technology, 
        hyperloop systems promise to transport passengers and cargo at incredible speeds, 
        significantly reducing travel times. This innovation has the potential to transform intercity travel 
        and revolutionize logistics.</p>
    <h2>Aerial Mobility</h2>
    <p>Advancements in electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and drone technology have 
        given rise to the concept of aerial mobility. These vehicles are designed to transport people and 
        goods efficiently through the airspace. Aerial mobility solutions could help alleviate traffic 
        congestion in urban areas, provide emergency medical services, and enhance logistics for goods delivery.
    </p>
    <h2>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)</h2>
    <p>Intelligent Transportation Systems utilize interconnected devices, sensors, and data analytics to 
        optimize traffic management, improve safety, and enhance the overall transportation experience. 
        ITS enables real-time traffic monitoring, adaptive traffic signals, and intelligent routing, 
        leading to smoother traffic flow, reduced congestion, and improved energy efficiency.</p>
    <h2>Shared Mobility Services</h2>
    <p>The rise of shared mobility services, such as ride-sharing and bike-sharing platforms, has 
        transformed the way people move within cities. These services leverage mobile applications and 
        technology to provide convenient, cost-effective transportation options. Shared mobility reduces 
        the number of privately-owned vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing traffic congestion and 
        emissions.</p>
    <h2>Sustainable Aviation</h2>
    <p>The aviation industry is actively exploring sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel. 
        Innovations in electric aircraft, hydrogen-powered planes, and biofuels are being developed to 
        reduce carbon emissions and make air travel more environmentally friendly. These advancements aim to 
        make aviation a greener mode of transportation without compromising safety and efficiency.</p>
