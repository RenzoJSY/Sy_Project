    <h1>Changes in Programming</h1>
    <p>Programming is the foundation of modern software development, and continuous innovations in programming 
       languages, frameworks, and methodologies are reshaping the way developers write code and build 
       applications. These advancements have significantly improved productivity, scalability, and the 
       overall development process. In this article, we explore some of the notable innovations in 
       programming that are revolutionizing the software development landscape.
    </p>
    <h2>Low-Code and No-Code Development</h2>
    <p>Low-code and no-code development platforms empower individuals with little to no coding experience 
        to build applications using visual interfaces and pre-built components. These platforms offer 
        drag-and-drop functionality, automated code generation, and simplified integration with existing 
        systems. Low-code and no-code development accelerates the application development process, reduces 
        the need for extensive coding, and enables citizen developers to participate in software development.</p>
    <h2>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Programming</h2>
    <p>Machine learning and AI are being increasingly utilized in programming to automate tasks and optimize 
        code. AI-powered code generators and program synthesis tools assist developers by automatically
        generating code snippets, suggesting optimizations, and identifying potential bugs. Additionally, 
        machine learning algorithms can analyze large codebases to detect patterns, improve code quality, 
        and provide intelligent code completion suggestions.</p>
    <h2>Functional Programming Paradigm</h2>
    <p>Functional programming, with languages like Haskell, Clojure, and Elixir, has gained popularity due 
        to its emphasis on immutability, higher-order functions, and declarative programming style. 
        Functional programming enables developers to write concise, modular, and more maintainable code. 
        The functional paradigm is particularly well-suited for parallel processing and distributed systems, 
        making it a preferred choice for building scalable and resilient applications.</p>
    <h2>Serverless Computing</h2>
    <p>Serverless computing, exemplified by cloud platforms like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, 
        abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, enabling developers to focus solely on writing 
        functions or business logic. With serverless, developers do not have to worry about provisioning 
        or managing servers, allowing for greater scalability, reduced costs, and increased flexibility. 
        Serverless architectures are well-suited for event-driven applications and highly dynamic workloads.</p>
    <h2>Reactive and Event-Driven Programming</h2>
    <p>Reactive programming, with frameworks like RxJava and Reactor, focuses on building responsive and 
        scalable applications by handling asynchronous events and data streams. Event-driven architectures 
        facilitate loose coupling and allow applications to respond to events in real-time. Reactive and 
        event-driven programming paradigms enable developers to build highly responsive, resilient, and
        scalable systems that can handle large amounts of data and concurrent requests.</p>
